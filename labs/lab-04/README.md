# Lab - 4 Reflection
> Build a compelling, fun version of the Hi-Low game that run in the browser using basic **JavaScript & DOM API**
## My reflection
This lab helped me understand how the Document Object Model (DOM) gives JavaScript access to manipulate HTML elements. I
learned how to use event listeners and callback functions to handle user interactions in the browser. The lab also
introduced the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which organizes an app into model, view, and controller
components for better structure and maintainability.
