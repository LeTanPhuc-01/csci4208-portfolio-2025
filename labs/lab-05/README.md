# Lab - 5 Reflection
> In this lab, you will build a complete, fast-paced "Dodger" game from the ground up. This isn't just about 
learning game development; it's about mastering core software engineering principles in a fun, hands-on 
way. 
 
You'll see firsthand how powerful concepts like **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** allow you to take a 
professional-grade framework like **Phaser** and extend it with your own custom, **modular code**. By the end, 
you'll have a fully funnctional game and a deeper understanding of how modern JS apps are built.
## My reflection
This lab taught me about the Web Developer Game Loop, which helped me understand and use Phaserâ€™s factory functions such as preload(), create(), and update(). I also learned how to organize code programmatically using classes and their defined properties for a game project. Managing the game state was another major takeaway from this lab.
