# Lab - 1 Reflection
> Build an Interative multi-page Story game using basic **HTML and just a bit of inline JS**
## My reflection
This lab introduced me to the basics of HTML and how it defines the structure of a web page. I learned about elements, attributes, and the foundation of an HTML page. It also helped me understand how a web browser functions as a client that displays HTML documents using HTTP or file protocols. I gained a clearer picture of how browsers parse and render web pages, and how JavaScript runs inside the browserâ€™s runtime environment, which normally resets on page reloads, leading to the need for Single Page Applications (SPAs) to maintain a continuous runtime.
